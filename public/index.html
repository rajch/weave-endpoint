    <h1>ReWeave</h1>
    <p>ReWeave is a fork of Weave Net, the first product developed by the 
      currently (and sadly) defunct Weaveworks.</p>
    <h2>About Weave Net</h2>
    <p>Weave Net creates a virtual network that connects containers across 
      multiple hosts and enables their automatic discovery. Applications 
      use the network just as if the containers were all plugged into the 
      same network switch, without having to configure port mappings, 
      ambassadors or links.</p>
    <h2>Installing Weave Net on Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>On a newly created Kubernetes cluster, the Weave Net CNI pluging 
      can be installed by running the following command:</p>
    <pre>
      kubectl apply -f https://reweave.azurewebsites.net/k8s/v1.28/net.yaml
    </pre>
    <p>Replace <code>v1.28</code> with the version on Kubernetes on your 
      cluster.</p>
